Python Gambling Simulator App using Tkinter

This Python application is built with the Tkinter library for its graphical user interface (GUI) and replicates a simple gambling algorithm. The app allows users to simulate a gambling experience, where they can place bets, track wins and losses, and observe the results generated by the algorithm.

Features:
User Interface: The app features a clean and interactive GUI built with Tkinter. Users can easily input their bet amount, view current balance, and initiate betting rounds.
Gambling Algorithm: The app mimics a basic gambling algorithm, which could simulate scenarios like a random win/loss system based on probability (e.g., 50/50 chance). The algorithm is designed to adjust the user’s balance after each round, taking into account the amount they bet and the result.
Balance Tracking: The app tracks the user’s balance, updating it after each betting round, displaying the current status in the interface.
Game Logic: The algorithm includes basic game mechanics, such as checking whether the user has won or lost the bet, calculating potential payouts, and modifying the balance accordingly.
Start and Reset Functions: Users can start a new game session or reset their progress at any time with dedicated buttons in the UI.
How it Works:
User Interaction: The user enters a bet amount and clicks "Place Bet."
Result Generation: The gambling algorithm randomly determines if the user wins or loses based on predefined probabilities.
Balance Update: The balance is updated after each round based on the win/loss outcome, with the interface reflecting the new total.
Simulation Loop: The user can continue to place bets, and the algorithm will continue simulating the betting rounds, providing feedback after each one.
